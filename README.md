### "FAIR re-use"

![FAIR re-use](/300dpi/fair-reuse-300dpi.png)

*FAIR sharing of data is beneficial for both data producers and consumers. Consumers gain access to interesting datasets that would otherwise be out of reach. Producers get citations to their work, when consumers publish their derivative work. OME-Zarr is the technology basis for enabling effective FAIR sharing of large image datasets.*
